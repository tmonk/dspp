Download the data as a CSV by clicking \"Export\" > \"CSV\" and save it to your assignment directory. It should be about 61mb and 266k rows.\n",

    "    - First subset the data to rows where Arrest is True.\n",
    "    - Use this to calculate the number of crimes of each type that lead to arrest.\n",
    "    - Divide this by the series you created in 2\n",
    "    - Finally, sort the values\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Among those types of crime for which there are at least 1000 incidents, which type is most likely to result in arrest?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Hint: Create a boolean series whose index is crime type and value is whether the count is at least 1000. Use that to subset your answer to 3 and then sort.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. What is the number of the community area with the most homicides in 2017? How many were there? What is the community area's name? (You can find a mapping of community area numbers to names online.)\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Create a boolean series indicating whether each crime involved a weapon. Then calculate the percentage of crimes involving a weapon. Hint: Look for descriptions containing words like 'WEAPON', 'GUN', and 'ARM'; but be careful because some descriptions contain 'NO WEAPON'.\n"
