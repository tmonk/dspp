## Course overview: Introduction to Data Science for Public Policy
 
This short course will introduce students to the Python programming language as a tool for applied data science. In PP455 we utilised Stata, the primary environment used by economists and public policy academics for regression analysis. Python is a more general-purpose tool from which we can perform a range of tasks, from data cleaning, transformation, and visualisation to more advanced techniques on the social science research frontier, such as natural language processing and machine learning.

The two-week course will take students from the first principles of Python programming to the application of data science packages such as NumPy and Pandas. Each class will be practical and hands-on, with the course focusing on the application of these tools in the public policy space. 
 
### Prerequisites 
A pass mark in PP455, or equivalent. 

### Schedule 
We meet daily 11:00-13:00 in NAB 2.09, with an additional class scheduled on Tuesday, 30 August 2022 from 14:00-16:00.


## Syllabus
This course is designed as an intensive two-week introduction to programming and data science for public policy students. The content covered will include:

- Programming in a setting of public policy - why should we care?
- Thinking algorithmically, taking policy questions to the data via a general-purpose programming language.
- Fundamentals of programming: code syntax, libraries, variables, data types, program control, functions, and IO.
- Data science through open-source python libraries. Cleaning, obtaining and analysing structured data.
- Introducing more advanced applications, such as web scraping and natural language processing.

## Course companion

There is not an assigned textbook for this course, but [Automate the Boring Stuff in Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) is a well written, free resource. It will cover everything we discuss in class, at least the Python side, and allow you to dive as deep as you wish into the language.
