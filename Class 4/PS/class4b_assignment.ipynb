    "Write the following 7 functions. You will use them later to complete part B. We can place these at the start of our file.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `read_salaries()`: Parse the included `salaries.csv` file. Your parser should:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Split each line on `','` and return a nested list where each element is itself a list of fields.\n",
    "  - Ignore/remove the first (header) line.\n",
    "  - Remove the dollar sign from the salary field.\n",
    "  -   Return a 2d list, `data`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `get_column(data, column_index)`: Given a 2d list `data` and an integer `column_index` (e.g. 0 for last name, 3 for department), return a (one dimensional) list of values for that column.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `count(values, search_value)`: Given a 1d list of `values` (e.g. the result of `get_column`), return the number of elements that are equal to `search_value`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `counts(values)`: Given a 1d list `values` (e.g. the result of `get_column`), return a dictionary of value-count pairs. (i.e two answer a question such as what is the most popular occupation?).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. `dict_max_value(d)`: Given a dictionary `d` with numeric values, return a list `[key, value]` of two elements, where `key` is the the key in `d` with the largest value, and `value` is it's value.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. `my_mean(numbers)`: given a list of numbers use the built-in functions `sum` and `len` to return their mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. `my_median(numbers)`: given a list of numbers calculate the median.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Your median function should *not* modify `numbers` inplace. Use the following logic for when `len(numbers)` is even: If `len(numbers)` is odd, take the middle element in the sorted list. If 'len(numbers)' is even, there will be two adjacent \"middle\" elements in the sorted list. Take the average between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "## B: Analysis of salaries\n",
    "Use our helper functions that we wrote above to solve the following questions!\n",
    "\n",
    "B.1: How many employees does the city have?\n",

    "\n",
    "B.7: What is the most common first name? Again, `q7` is written for you. What you'll need to do is modify the parser:\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that when you split on ',' in your parser, you separated the employee first and last and first names. However, there will be a double quote at the beginning of the last name field and the end of the first name field. So update `helper.read_salaries` to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Remove the quotation marks.\n",
    "- Remove extra white space from the beginning of the first name field.\n",
    "- If the first name field has a middle name, remove it.\n",
    "    - Hint: Split on ' ' and keep the first element.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, this line from `salaries.csv`:\n",
    "\n",

    "\"AARON,  JEFFERY M\",SERGEANT,POLICE,F,Salary,,$101442.00,\n",

    "```\n",
    "['AARON', 'JEFFERY', 'SERGEANT', 'POLICE', 'F', 'Salary', '', 101442.0, '']\n",
    "```\n",
    "B.8: What are the minimum, mean, median, and maximum salaries?\n",
    "\n",
    "`q8` is partially written for you. You'll need to get the salaries from the data, ignoring/removing those that are empty (wage workers). You'll also need to update `helper.read_salaries` to convert salaries, when present, to a number. Hint: first remove the dollar sign and then use the type conversion function `float`.\n"
